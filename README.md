# BookProgressManager

## Purpose
This project will be used for two kinds of purpose:
- for end-user: to manage the book progress of individual reader, including book list, book category, progress/status of each one;
- for developer: can use this project to learn/practise/improve developer skill of React Native / Reactjs
This project was originally developed from 2021 by only one person (ThanhCong28).

## Detail description
I ((ThanhCong28) am a software developer who is learning and practising Reactjs, React Native. On the other hand, I have so many books at home which need to be managed (reading status/progress, categorized, statistics...).

So, I decided to make a React project (at first, by React Native) for managing book progress. In this project, I have overall the roles of UI designer, developer, tester and end-user, of course ^^
